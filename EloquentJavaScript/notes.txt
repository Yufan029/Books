Chapter 3 Function

Closure
    This feature - being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope - is called closure.

    A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure.


    A good mental model: 
        is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created.

        when called, the function body sees the environment in which it was created, not the environment in which it is called.
